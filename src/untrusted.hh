// Regions of the detector a user has marked untrusted -- a backstop, its arm,
// a shadow -- drawn with mxi_mask and kept in each image set's block of the
// experiment list, so that they travel with the data through every program:
//
//     "untrusted": [{"panel": 0, "circle": [x, y, r]},
//                   {"panel": 0, "rectangle": [x0, y0, x1, y1]},
//                   {"panel": 0, "polygon": [[x, y], [x, y], ...]}]
//
// in pixels, as DIALS counts them: pixel i spans i to i + 1, so a pixel is
// inside a shape when its centre, i + 0.5, is. Rasterised for a frame, they
// join the detector's own pixel_mask (Series::add_masked), so that spot
// finding and integration, on the CPU and on a device, leave them out as they
// leave out the detector's bad pixels.
