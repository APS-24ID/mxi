# Release notes

Newest first. Each release lists first what changes results or commands -- a
default changed, an option renamed or gone -- then what is new, then what is
fixed. The tag of each (`git tag -n99 v1.0.5`) carries the same summary.

## Unreleased -- since 1.1.5

**New**
- The image viewer's tools for untrusted regions are a **Masking** menu in its
  toolbar -- the four drawing modes, Undo, Clear, Same as previous, Save --
  leaving the image their row; its label says how many regions, whether saved,
  and what a click draws.
- The image viewer (`mxi view`, mxi ui's View images) shows which image as a
  slider under the toolbar, as wide as the window, in place of the number box:
  where the image is among the sweep's at a glance, and dragged, each shown as
  fast as images can be read; an arrow each side to step one, and which image
  it is beside them, its number editable to go straight to one.
- The image viewer (`mxi view`, mxi ui's View images) colours several lattices
  on a sweep apart: each lattice's spots in a colour of its own and its
  predictions in a lighter tint of it, each a layer to show or hide, the
  unindexed spots red as before.
- `mxi triage SCALED.rflx`, begun: what the scaled intensities say of
  twinning, as phenix.xtriage says it -- the moments, N(Z) and the L test,
  independent of twin laws; the twin laws the lattice allows, each one's R and
  H-test fraction; a summary that calls the data twinned only where both kinds
  say so, and a symmetry missed where twin-related pairs are equal but the L
  test is not twin-like (docs/triage.md).

**Changed**
- `mxi integrate` fits reflections whose foregrounds overlap, of one lattice
  or several, together -- each with its own lattice's profile, the shared
  pixels apportioned between them -- and takes their neighbours' counts out of
  their summed intensities, where each alone had counted its neighbours'
  photons as its own. This changes the default output: overlapped reflections
  have different profile-fitted and summed intensities, and every integrated
  file has a column `profile.fitted_together`, the summary a count. On
  Graeme's two crystals of insulin, the 1100 or so overlapped measurements
  went from +0.92 sigma from their equivalents, rms 3.79, to +0.07 and 1.06.
  `--no-fit-overlaps` fits each alone, as before.
- `mxi index` estimates the largest cell in a fraction of the time: on
  Graeme's 428 349 spots of a 128 A cell, the max cell 10.21 s before, 0.28 s
  now, and the whole run 13.2 s before, 2.9 s now -- every candidate cell, the
  cell chosen and the 414 387 indexed exactly as before. Its test for
  overlapping boxes had looked up each reflection's experiment and panel by
  column name for each of some 127 million pairs of boxes; its
  nearest-neighbour search kept its cells in a tree, searched whole cubes, ran
  on one thread, and with points nearly in a plane made its cells minute. Now
  each reflection's experiment and panel are read once, the cells are one
  array with each shell's own visited, the points are shared among the
  threads, and the cells are sized from the points' widest span. The same
  neighbours, the same largest cell, to the bit.

## 1.1.5 -- 5 November 2026

**Changed**
- `mxi view` is mxi ui's image viewer, in a window of its own, no longer
  napari's: the same command and options (`-o`, `--sum`, `--sweep`), and Save
  writing `masked.rflx` and `mxi_mask.json` where it is run, as before. It
  needs Python with tkinter, numpy, h5py and hdf5plugin, as mxi ui does, and
  no napari; the wheel's `[napari]` extra is gone. Regions are rectangles,
  circles and polygons, drawn, chosen and deleted, undone; what napari's
  shapes layer had besides -- ellipses, freehand polygons, moving a region or
  its vertices -- is gone: a region is deleted and drawn again.

**New**
- `mxi show` shows only what is asked for: `--models`, `--unit-cell` (each
  crystal's cell a line and nothing else, for reading or for another program
  -- the tutorial had grepped for it), `--reflections`, `--summary`, `--step
  NAME` (one step's record). With none, everything, as before.
- mxi ui's viewer draws the detector's untrusted regions: rectangles, circles
  and polygons on a sweep's images, chosen and deleted, undone a step at a
  time, the same as the previous sweep's; saved as `mxi view` saves them, into
  `masked.rflx` through `mxi untrusted` and `mxi_mask.json`, and Find spots
  then reads `masked.rflx`. Closing with regions not saved asks first.
- mxi ui has a Quit button (and Cmd-Q, Ctrl-Q), and its viewer a Close button
  (Cmd-W, Ctrl-W): each asks first where something would be lost -- a command
  running, regions drawn and not saved, in the viewer or, quitting, in any
  viewer open.
- mxi ui's notes, for learning: beneath each step's form, what it does, what
  to look at in its results, what goes wrong and which option answers it, and
  links to the guides that say more. Every option a note names is checked
  against its command's `--help`.
- mxi ui's plots: integration a sweep at a time, a line each, where there are
  several -- more than 8, each a grey line under their median and a bar a
  sweep for its overall <I/sigma> and profile correlation; and the Correlation
  tool's -- the correlation and cosine-angle matrices in OPTICS's order, the
  reachability coloured by cluster, the data sets' principal components, the
  functional by dimension -- from the `mxi_correlation.json` it now always
  writes. The tool reads `scaled.rflx` by default, as `mxi correlation` takes,
  where it had offered `symmetrized.rflx`. The Plots tab scrolls where there
  are more than it shows, by its scrollbar, a wheel or a trackpad.
- mxi ui's viewer sums images: from the one shown, as many as are asked for,
  so that a shadow or faint spots show; the spots on any of them marked, the
  contrast set afresh.
- `mxi_tools` finds mxi by the `MXI` environment variable first, as mxi ui
  does.
- `docs/process.md`, a guide to `mxi process`: where each option goes, where
  it starts from a `.rflx` and why, what to do when a step fails, and the ways
  through -- one crystal, a mask first, many crystals to their clusters --
  with their flows, drawn by GitHub from the Markdown.

**Fixed**
- `mxi process masked.rflx` -- a file `mxi untrusted` wrote -- had been
  refused, neither its writer nor its summary's last step having a step to
  follow: it goes on from spot finding, as `docs/mask.md` has it, whatever
  file was masked. And a file whose writer has no step of its own (`mxi
  split`, `mxi combine`) goes on after the last step its summary records that
  has one, where it had looked at its last step only.

## 1.1.4 -- 4 November 2026

**Changed**
- A cluster `mxi correlation --write-clusters` writes carries its own
  crystals' history, not the whole run's: each step's record cut to its sweeps
  and experiments, the whole run's figures left out and named, scaling's
  record left out (a cluster is scaled afresh), and correlation's own record
  -- the cluster, its data sets, the file it was cut from. Its report, and mxi
  ui's summaries, are its crystals'.
- mxi's Python tools are one wheel, `mxi-python`, where mxeq's was its own:
  mxeq, the referee, under the same import name and command; `mxi_tools`,
  which reads mxi's files and images; the viewer `mxi-view` (napari through
  the `[napari]` extra); and `mxi-ui`. matplotlib is now a dependency. The
  release's wheel is `mxi_python-1.1.4-py3-none-any.whl`; where the `mxeq`
  wheel was installed, `pip uninstall mxeq` first.

**New**
- `mxi process MASTER.nxs...`, for routine data: the whole sequence, import to
  export, a step at a time, each the command a script of them would run, with
  its own output and log. `-j` goes to every step, `--gpu` to spot finding and
  integration, `--cell` and `--space-group` to indexing (the cell as
  `--known-cell`) and the space group to scaling, `--no-joint` to indexing for
  several crystals, `--d-min-auto` to scaling. Given one `.rflx` instead, `mxi
  process FILE.rflx` picks up after the step that wrote it and finishes: a
  cluster from `mxi correlation --write-clusters` is scaled afresh and
  exported. A step that fails stops it, saying which, its exit code, its log,
  and how to go on -- its own command, or `mxi process` on its input;
  `--dry-run` prints the commands and runs none.
- `mxi ui`, an interface to mxi, for processing data and for teaching
  (docs/ui.md). The workflow's steps and tools down the side, each marked done
  from the working directory, so that a directory processed before opens as it
  stands. Each step a form -- its inputs, main options, output, threads and
  further options, each field's option a tooltip -- building the mxi command
  as it is filled in, shown to copy, and run with its output streamed into the
  Log, cancellable. Each step's Summary and Plots read from its file's
  records, not its log: its figures and tables, the merging statistics as
  DIALS lays them out; spots per image and by resolution, RMSDs by cycle, the
  cell over the scan, <I/sigma>, CC half, completeness and the R factors by
  resolution, with matplotlib. And View images: a step's images in a window of
  their own, each spot drawn as its box, indexed apart from unindexed,
  predictions; zoom by buttons, keys, a right-button drag or a scroll;
  contrast and colour maps; the pixel, its counts and its resolution under the
  cursor.
- `mxi ui` runs with tkinter, matplotlib, numpy, h5py and hdf5plugin -- no Qt
  -- and where tkinter is missing it says what to install for the system (`mxi
  ui --check`). It is in the release archives beside mxi, and in the wheel as
  `mxi-ui`.

**Not yet**
- Untrusted regions are still drawn in `mxi view` (napari) or set with `mxi
  untrusted`; the interface's viewer will draw them, and then replace `mxi
  view`.
